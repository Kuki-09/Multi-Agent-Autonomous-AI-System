Subject: Issue with Recent Purchase – Order #45672

Dear Customer Support,

I recently purchased a wireless keyboard from your website (Order #45672), and I’m extremely disappointed with the product quality. The keyboard started malfunctioning within just two days — some keys are unresponsive, and the Bluetooth connection keeps dropping intermittently.

I chose your brand based on positive reviews, but this experience has been frustrating. I’ve attached a short video demonstrating the issue.

Please advise if I can get a replacement or refund. I’d appreciate a quick resolution to this matter.

Sincerely,  
Ananya Mehra
