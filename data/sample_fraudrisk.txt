Subject: Urgent Attention Required â€“ Suspicious Financial Activity Detected

Dear Risk Management Team,

Our internal monitoring system has flagged multiple high-value transactions made from user account ID 87451 during non-business hours. The payment amounts significantly exceed the normal range and were routed to unverified foreign bank accounts.
Additionally, there were unauthorized changes made to user profile details just before the transactions occurred.
We suspect fraudulent behavior and request an immediate freeze on the account and a forensic audit.

Sincerely,  
Ankit Mehra  
Fraud Analyst
